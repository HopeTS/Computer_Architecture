#### DeMorgan's Law:
    - (!(A & B) <=> !A || !B)

#### Universal Gates:
    - Not & And gates
    - Fredkin Gate
    - (!A & !A <=> !A)
    - (!!(A & B) <=> A & B)

#### Fredkin Gate:
    - Number of 1's in a Fredkin gate never changes
    - "You don't need power for computation if you're willing to wait."
    - Can be used in quantum computing. (Quantum Fredkin Gate)

#### Multiplexer (Mux):

#### HDL/VHDL:
    - Hardware Description Language
    - Used to describe boolean logic

#### D Flip Flop:
    - Stores binary data that can only be changed at the clock edge
    - Commonly used for synchronization

#### N-Bit Register:

#### Finite State Machines:

You can construct any binary function with only and, or & not gates.
