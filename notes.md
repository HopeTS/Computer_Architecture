## Computer Organization & Architecture

___
###### 9/4/19

#### _DeMorgan's Law_:
    - (!(A & B) <=> !A || !B)

#### _Universal Gates_:
    - Not & And gates
    - Fredkin Gate
    - (!A & !A <=> !A)
    - (!!(A & B) <=> A & B)

#### _Fredkin Gate_:
    - Number of 1's in a Fredkin gate never changes
    - "You don't need power for computation if you're willing to wait."
    - Can be used in quantum computing. (Quantum Fredkin Gate)

#### _Multiplexer_ (Mux):

#### _HDL/VHDL_:
    - Hardware Description Language
    - Used to describe boolean logic

#### _D Flip Flop_:
    - Stores binary data that can only be changed at the clock edge
    - Commonly used for synchronization
    - (https://electronicsforu.com/resources/learn-electronics/flip-flop-rs-jk-t-d)

#### N-Bit Register:

#### Finite State Machines:

1. You can construct any binary function with only and, or & not gates.

#### _Computer Architecture_:
    - What the programmer sees
    - Targets ISA (_Instruction Set Architecture_)
    - Assembly deals directly with computer architecture

#### _Computer Organization_:

1. __Four basic functions computers perform__:
    1. Data processing
    2. Data storage
    3. Data movement
        - I/O
        - Data communications (internal/external networking)
    4. Control
        - _Control Unit_ manages computer resources and orchestrates performance of functional parts.
