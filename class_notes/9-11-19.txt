1965: Gordon Moore - co-founder of Intel

Moore's Law: Number of transistors per unit area doubles every 6 (now 18) months
  Consequences:
    - Cost of computer logic/memory fallen dramatically
    - Electrical path length is shortened. operating speed++
    - Computers get smaller
    - Reduction in power/cooling requirements
    - Fewer interchip connections

16 MiB <=> 2^4 * 2^10 * 2^10 <=> 2^4 * 2^20
