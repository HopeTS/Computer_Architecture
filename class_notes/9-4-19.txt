Any binary function only needs and, or & not gates.

Not & And gates are 'Universal Gates' 
    - (not A & not A <=> not A)
    - (not not (A & B) <=> A & B)
    
DeMorgan's Law: (Not (A & B) <=> not A or not B)

Fredkin Gate (Universal gate)
    - Number of 1s in a Fredkin gate never changes
    - "You don't need power for computation if you're willing to wait"
    - Can be used in quantum computing. (Quantum Fredkin Gates)
    
Multiplexer (Mux):

HDL/VHDL: Hardware Description Language
    - Describes Boolean logic
    
D Flip Flop: Stores binary data that can only be changed at the clock edge
    - Commonly used for synchronization
