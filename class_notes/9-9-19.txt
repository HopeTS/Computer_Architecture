Computer Architecture:
	- What the programmer sees
	- Targets Instruction Set Architecture
	- Working with Comp Architecture with assembly

Computer Organization:
	

IBM System 370 Architecture:
	- Introduced 1970
	- Included multiple models
	- Able to upgrade to faster model without abandoning original software
	- New models improve technology but retain architecture
	- This architecture survived to today, being used in IBM mainframe product line

Structure/Function:
	- Hierarchical system
	- Hierarchical nature of complex systems essential for design and description
	- Designer works with a single level of the system at a time
	- Structure: Way components relate to each other
	- Function: Operation of individual components as part of the structure

Function:
	- Four basic functions computers perform:
		- Data processing
		- Data storage
		- Data movement
			- I/O
			- Data communications (internal and external networking)
		- Control
			- Control unit manages computer resources and orchestrates performance of functional parts

HISTORY OF COMPUTERS

First Gen: vacuum tubes:
	- Vacuum tubes used for digital logic elements and memory
	- IAS Computer
		- Fundamental design approach was the stored program concept
			- von Neumann
			- First publication of idea in 1945 for EDVAC
		- Design began in Princeton university
